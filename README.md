# Rain World Detector

There is somebody in a Discord server I mod that loves to talk about Rain World. So I made this to keep tabs on their Rain World mentions.

## ✨ Features

- Track mentions of Rain World made by any one user (this can obviously be changed to include everybody).
- Use a command to track how many mentions have been made.

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Your target mentions Rain World.
- Use `!rainworldcount` to track their usage.

## 📝 Notes

If the bot goes offline or is redeployed, the counter will be reset. I have it set for my specific use case, but you can edit that if you'd like.
